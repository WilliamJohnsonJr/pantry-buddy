## Getting Started

* In one terminal window: `npm start`.
* In another terminal window: `npm run json-server`.
* Go to `localhost:4200` and have fun!


## How To Make Your Own

To start an NgRx project from scratch, you can use these commands (at least for Angular 8, Angular CLI 8, RxJs 6, and Angular Material 8):

* `npm install -g @angular/cli`  (you have to have it installed globally to run the CLI commands, but it uses the @angular/cli version specified in a project’s package.json by default — that is, if you’re using @angular/cli@6+ and your project uses @angular/cli@1.7.2, you’ll be fine because it will use version 1.7.2 when working in the project)

* `ng version`  (verifies install)

* `ng config -g cli.packageManager npm`  (or yarn, etc. to set your global ng packageManager config)

* `ng new pantry-buddy —style scss`  (sets up an angular project with SCSS as the style syntax)

* `ng add @angular/material` Add Material

* `npm install @ngrx/{store,router-store,effects,entity,store-devtools}`  Add NgRx tools and dependencies

* `npm install ngrx-store-freeze --save` Add NgRx Store Freeze

* `npm install -g json-server` (CLI for a simple CRUD JSON server)

* `json-server —watch db.json`    (to start json-server)

* `ng generate @angular/material:material-nav --name=app-nav-shell` (create a Sidenav Material component)

* Use app-nav-shell as an app shell and place everything inside it.
